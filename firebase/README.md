**Tutorial:** less than 2 hours

**Tutorial + Extra Credit:** ??? but definitely more than 2 hours

**Caveat:** *These are totally estimates that will vary based on your familiarity with web development concepts, and if you've ever used any of the technologies in this tutorial, and if the way that I explain things makes as much sense to your brain as it does to my brain.*
