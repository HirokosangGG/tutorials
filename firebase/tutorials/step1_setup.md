## DURING

Go to the [Firebase website](https://www.firebase.com/account) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. You can log in with a Google account for easy access.

A simple database is first created for you when you make a new account. It's named **MY FIRST APP**, and you can start using it right away!

![My First App](../images/screenshot_new_account.png)

Note the unique URL assigned to your app â€” it probably looks something like **[adjective]-fire-[number].firebase.io**. This is your **Firebase URL** and it's pretty important. It describes where to find all the data for this app. We'll refer to the first part of this URL as **your-firebase-app** throughout the rest of this tutorial.

Check out your database's Dashboard by clicking on **MY FIRST APP**, or by navigating directly to **your-firebase-app.firebase.io**. You might be prompted to take a tour of the Dashboard. If you have time, go ahead and the take the tour to learn how to edit data from your Dashboard and otherwise manage your database from the Firebase website. When you're ready, move on to the next step of this tutorial.

### EXTRA CREDIT

1. Change your application's name (hint: you can do this from [https://www.firebase.com/account](https://www.firebase.com/account))
2. Take the Dashboard tour when you first navigate to **your-firebase-app.firebase.io**

## AFTER

You created a Firebase account, which comes with a database ready to use.

You know **your-firebase-app** (aka your Firebase URL), which uniquely describes your database. You can access your database's Dashboard at **your-firebase-app.firebase.io**.
